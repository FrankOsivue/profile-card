                <h3>My bio</h3>
                <p>I’m a Computer Science student who found my way into coding through Angela Yu’s web development
                    course on Udemy. That
                    experience opened my eyes to how fun and creative programming can be. Since then, I’ve been growing
                    as a frontend
                    developer by learning via freecodecamp and Altschool. I am currently focusing on learning by
                    building, this why I am in HNG Internship</p>

                <h3>My goals</h3>
                <p>I’m working towards mastering frontend development and landing a role where I can keep learning and
                    building real-world
                    projects. In the long run, I want to mentor and support upcoming developers.</p>

                <h3>Areas I need to Improve</h3>
                <p>I’m still building my confidence in JavaScript and improving my overall
                    frontend skills. To get better, I’ve been
                    practicing through Frontend Mentor challenges and small personal projects.

                <p>You’ve got this, Mark. Every line of code you write brings you closer to becoming the world-class
                    developer you dream
                    of. keep pushing and you’ll make it to the final stage of HNG.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Skills take time and dedication to build. To be a
                    great programmer is not only about innate ability, but willingness to
                    push through difficult tasks.
